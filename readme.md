Spitballing ideas for making a retro style text adventure with RPG elements for the Trs-80 4P

Emulator used: http://48k.ca/trs80gp.html

I was considering making a retro Basic programming tutorial and wanted to make a demo of the project first.

This should technically work on all TRS-80 models with minor adjustments to the screen commmands, but I chose the 4P because it has 80 column text.

There are a lot of improvements to make, but as I will be starting again from scratch, I didn't want to take this one too far down the road before throwing it out. Most of the text adventure logic is in place, yet new data needs to be added; and the rpg elements are mostly lacking as yet.

I also need to consider programming basics for beginners and demonstrate easy principles before it gets too complicated.
