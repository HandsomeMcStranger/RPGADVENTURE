Spitballing ideas for making a retro style text adventure with RPG elements for the TRS-80 4/4P.


Emulator used: http://48k.ca/trs80gp.html

I was considering making a retro Basic programming tutorial and wanted to make a demo of the project first.

This should technically work on all TRS-80 models with minor adjustments to the screen placement commmands, but I chose the 4/4P because it has 80 column text.

There are a lot of improvements to make, but as I will be starting again from scratch, I didn't want to take this one too far down the road before throwing it out. Most of the text adventure logic is in place, yet new data needs to be added; and the rpg elements are mostly lacking as yet.

I also need to consider programming basics for beginners and demonstrate easy principles before it gets too complicated.


Installation:

1: Type BASIC into the emulator.

2: Copy the source code into the clipboard.

3: CTL-ALT-V to paste it directly into the emulator

4: RUN


I sometimes have a glitch when pasting where it will miss out odd characters here and there. If this happens, try pasting again. Or isolating the lines with syntax errors and repasting just those.

I will perhaps include a disk image later on, if you see it in the repositary, copy it to your TRS-80 folder and insert it into drive :1
you can then load it from within basic by typing LOAD "RPGADVENT/BAS:1" or from the DOS prompt by typing BASIC RPGADVENT/BAS:1
